# Versioning

Terra components use semantic versioning (see http://semver.org/ for further information).

We differentiate between these changes:

-   MAJOR: Angular update to a new major release or other possible breaking changes
-   MINOR: New features or other non-breaking changes
-   PATCH: Non-breaking bug fixes

There will be a [changelog](https://github.com/plentymarkets/terra-components/blob/beta7/CHANGELOG.md) entry for every new release.
